# What Why
Python script to dynamically change wallpaper depending on current solar event, ie sunrise sunset dawn

I couldn't find anything that did this elegantly already on my linux environment

# What to adjust
WALLPAPERS mapping

Latitude longitude in requests.get

swww calls if you're using a different wallpaper manager
